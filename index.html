                <h2>Familiarize myself with AWS so that I can gain proficiency with the services/tools.</h2>
                <p>                 
                    To get familiarized with AWS I completed a Udemy course 
                    Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - 2022, the cbsa provided for me. Where I learned
                    a lot of AWS fundamentals such as <b>EC2, S3, and RDS.</b> I also have used a mutitude of AWS tools such as <b>cloud9, code commit, appConfig,</b> and <b>cloudWatch</b> in 
                    order to complete Jira tickets. Now I am able to comfortably and confidently navigate and use the tools of the services.
                    Overall I think I can say I have gained a lot of knowlege in using AWS such that I can bring forward the knowledge from this job to another 
                    or even into another cloud service. 
                    
                </p>
                
                <h2>Broaden my front end knowledge and capabilities.</h2>
                <p>
                    Before this coop term I only knew a little bit of basic <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> so during this term I wanted to 
                    become more proficient in those language as well as learn <b>Javascript</b> and <b>React.</b>
                    Since most of the applications I worked on at the cbsa used React I starting learning by
                    watching videos and researching. It also helped that I did a lot of pair programming with an expereienced coworker 
                    who showed me a lot of good code practices and desgin tips. A very great library that I was introduced to is <b>Ant Design</b>
                    which had a lot of flexible theme customization and rich components to create a very professional look.
                    UI is not just coding it also involves a lot of design and during my time on this job I was also able to 
                    observe and create mockups in <b>Figma.</b>
                    My frontend capabilities have definitely been expanded during my time here since I have had to create professional web pages and add 
                    elements precisely to how another person has requested or following figma mockups.
                    I have also become familiar with the use of libaries like Ant Desgin for React which
                    has greatly improved the visual asthetic of my pages.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Improve my programming problem solving and debugging skills.</h2>
                <p>
                    To improve my problem solving and debugging skills I first try to anaylze the problem, write it out, and research.
                    A great tool my coworker has taught me to use which has helped me locate the issue for a lot of problems in a timely manner is 
                    using the <b>JavaScript Debug Terminal.</b> Which allows me to add breakpoints and step through the code seeing the values to check if thats what I was expecting
                    as well as showing exactly where the code breaks instead of 
                    just mindlessly searching. Also after using the debugger I develop more
                    of an eye for catching bugs since I understand the 
                    step through of the code more. Further, I observed my coworkers thought process as they code and took  
                    on small tasks on call with them and asking them to explain how they would approach it when I don't understand. 
                    Thanks to this work experience I think I have significantly improved my programming and debugging skills since I am more comfortable tackling a problem 
                    without extensive researching/searching beforehand. Bugs and errors are prone to happen in this line of work which is why being able to understand and fix
                    problems is so important. Now that I know more tips and tricks to problem solving and debugging 
                    I can transfer this knowledge to my school assignments and future placements.

                </p>
                
                <h2>Establish personal orgainzation and great time management skills</h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to develop self discipline since working remotely requires me to allocate my time wisely throughout the workday. I was able to create
                    a good habit of a routine by starting off my day at the same time and participating 
                    in <b>stand-up meetings</b> every morning then planning out my work schedule with <b>Jira</b> tickets.
                    This work term has really helped me establish time management because I have a set schedule and estimated time
                    frame I need to get me tickets done in. A big problem of mine is procastination but working here has helped me establish organization because I need to get 
                    work done in each day whereas with school assignments I have mutiple days to weeks to start and complete.
                    Creating a habit is the hardest part and now that I have been persistent with the routine for 8 months I am confident with my ability to continue it 
                     following my return into the school year.

                <h2>Learn how to thorougly test an application</h2>
                <p>
                    Testing an application before releasing it is extremely important and necessary skill to have as a software engineer.
                    For almost all the code I wrote I needed to write a test for it so
                    I learned how to test my code using <b>Jest</b> which is a JavaScript framework. 
                    Having these tests are very advantageous because with incremental implementation
                    and often changing code, you can see when a function breaks and you need to go
                    back to fix it. 
                    I have learned some basic ideas for testing software in my design classes however after this work term I have amassed a
                    lot more knowledge on how to identify edge cases and bugs. Since I was apart of the creation of an application start to end I was 
                    also involved with the testing period where I worked with tester coworkers and fixing the tickets they make of the bugs they
                    uncovered which I did not think of when I first made it. This gave me a lot to think about and be concious of when 
                    creating and implementing applications in the future.

                    During my time at the Canada Border Services Agency I was placed on the <b> cloud computing </b> team in the
                    travellers division and information science and technology branch. On this team the individuals were
                    focused on maintaining, developing, and optimizing web applications on the cloud mainly using
                    <b>Amazon Web Services</b>.
                    The project I worked on for the duration of my coop is VTIS which came to life out of the need an 
                    application for boat vessels and cruises.
                    At the time the current state of travel for cruises had no existing processing application for its manifest and 
                    the travellers were not being captured into a passage history meaning valuable data was being lost.          
                    Therefore I was placed in a team of 4 tasked to create and complete an application start-to-end that would 
                    facilitate the processing and managing of a cruises passanger and crew manifests. 
                    For this project the main aspect I was placed on was creating
                    the API endpoints the frontend would call to fetch, put, update or delete data to and from the database.
                    I used <b>SQL</b> to access and manipulate the database for the type of requests that I needed to handle
                    which included GET, DELETE, POST, and PUT. For almost all the code I wrote I also wrote test using <b>Jest.</b>
                    When I was finished with the API I also jumped onto the 
                    frontend and created interaces using <b>HTML, CSS and React.js</b>.

                    This coop work term truly enhanced my academic experience since I learned more 
                    about my field and programming in a very pratical and hands-on manner. 
                    There are certain topics and data structures I remember learning in school
                    that I didn't delve very deeply into however on this work term I really 
                    got into the application and functional uses for them. For example even something as simple 
                    as <b>regex</b> while working I realized I had lot more learning and expanding to do in order to 
                    use it to its full potential and be able to manipulate
                    and isolate the data I needed. Same with concepts like <b>polymorphism</b> which we briefly touched on in school
                    but through experimenting and researching due to the needs of my projects and tasks, I have 
                    grown to more fully grasp the concept. Similarly, I learned a lot about the Agile workflow 
                    and benefits to working in teams in my Software classes 
                    however nothing can compare to actually experiencing the development process for myself to better
                    understand its advantages and methodology. This coop workterm really solidifed a lot of knowledge I began 
                    learning in school and really continued and broadened my education.

                    Working at the Canada Border Services Agency has been a truly unforgettable and 
                    invaluable experience. This was my first job in the tech industry and I got a 
                    taste of what the future holds with realistic work experience from stand-up meetings, working with industry professionals,
                    pair programming, code review, testing, and programming. From this experience I gained a lot
                    of cloud computing knowledge and interest in furthering my education in this. I have also realized I 
                    really enjoy full-stack development having now worked on both the front-end and back-end for applications.
                    This work term has really solidified my interest in tech and I can't wait to continue learning 
                    and working in this industry.
