                <h2>Gain knowledge and experience with working with Docker containers and Kubernetes.</h2>
                <p>                 
                    Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with
                    all of its dependencies, such as libraries, and ship it all out as one package. This ensures that the application will run smoothly and consistently 
                    across different environments. While a Kubernetes cluster provides a scalable infrastructure for running containerized applications. Throughout my 
                    work term, all the services I worked on utilized Docker for running, providing me with extensive experience in creating Docker images and deploying 
                    them for testing purposes. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain practical proficiency in managing Docker containers and understanding 
                    their role in software development and deployment workflows. Additionally, this experience provided me with a solid understanding of containerization 
                    principles and deployment strategies, enhancing my ability to effectively utilize these for software development and testing.
